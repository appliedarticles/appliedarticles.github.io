For the most part, the top tech companies are far more similar than different. There really aren’t “Google interview questions” or “Microsoft interview questions.” Each interviewer decides on his or her own questions, and almost any question asked at one company would fit in just as well at any of the other companies.

However, certain companies have minor slants toward particular types of questions:

- **Google** tends to emphasize questions on scalability more than other companies (for instance, “Design a web crawler”). Questions on bit manipulation are also quite common.

- **Amazon** loves object-oriented design questions. If you’re going to interview at Amazon, make sure you study these problems. And, since Amazon is a web-based company, you’ll also want to prepare for scalability questions.

- **Microsoft** is all over the map, which is to be expected since it has a pretty diverse set of projects. Its interviewers tend to ask more questions about C and C++. If you don’t list these languages on your resume, you have nothing to fear. However, if you do list these languages, you’ll want to make sure that you’re comfortable coding in them. Additionally, Microsoft tends to emphasize testing and design skills more in developers than other companies do, so be prepared for these questions.

- **Apple** wants people who are really passionate about the company. Make sure you understand Apple’s products, especially those of the team you are interviewing with. What would you improve about the product? Remember that Apple has a lot of smart people who haven’t yet done what you’re suggesting. Think about why they haven’t.

- **Facebook** has specific roles for their interviewers to ensure a diversity of questions. They often prioritize being a good hacker; that is, can you get stuff done? Be prepared to talk about your prior experience.

A good rule of thumb is to look at the position and the company. If it’s a web-based company, team, or role, you should expect some scalability questions. If it’s a front-end position, expect some front-end questions. But for almost all companies, expect algorithm and problem-solving questions.
