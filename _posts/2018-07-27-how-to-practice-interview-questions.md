When it comes to practicing interview questions, quality matters more than quantity. There are literally thousands of sample interview questions online for companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Don’t try to memorize the answers. It’s impossible and won’t help you anyway.

Take your time-solving problems, and try the following seven-step approach in practicing questions:

1. Implement the common data structures and algorithms from scratch, first by hand and then via a computer. A lot of interview questions require this knowledge, so it’s essential that you are very comfortable with them. Derive the time complexity for these algorithms as well.
2. Practice with real interview questions. A book on algorithms or data structures might be useful, but it’s often far beyond the knowledge that you need to know. Let interview questions be your guide for what you need to know.
3. Try to solve the problem on your own—really try to solve it. If you read a question and get stuck solving it, that’s okay and normal. Questions are designed to be tough. Don’t give up, though. Keep working through the problem.
4. Write the code for the algorithm on paper. You’ve been coding all your life on a computer, and you’ve gotten used to the many nice things about it: compilers, code completion, and so on. You won’t have any of these in an interview, so the old-fashioned way, down to every last semicolon.
5. Test your code! By hand, that is. No cheating with a computer!
6. Type your code into a computer exactly as is. Rerun both the test cases you tried and some new ones.
7. Start a list of all the mistakes you made, and analyze what types of mistakes you make the most often. Are these specific mistakes?
