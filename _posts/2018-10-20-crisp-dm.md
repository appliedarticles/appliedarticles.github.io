## Introduction
CRISP-DM was conceived in late 1996 by three veterans of the young and immature data mining market. CRISP stands for "***CR***oss-***I***ndustry ***S***tandard ***P***rocess for ***D***ata ***M***ining." 

This process model for data mining provides an overview of the life cycle of a data mining project. It contains all the phases of a project, their respective tasks, and the relationships between these tasks. Relationships could exist between any data mining tasks depending on the goals, the background, and the interest of the user-and most importantly-on the data.

## CRISP-DM Phases
The life cycle of a data mining project consists of six phases as shown-

_Data Science Project Life Cycle_

## 1. Business Understanding
This initial phase focuses on understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective, then converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition and a preliminary plan designed to achieve the objectives. 

***Generic Tasks:***
- Determine business objectives.
- Assess situation.
- Determine data mining goals.
- Produce project plan.

## 2. Data Understanding
The data understanding phase starts with initial data collection and proceeds with activities that enable you to become familiar with the data.

***Generic Tasks:***
- Collect initial data.
- Describe data.
- Explore data.
- Verify data quality.

## 3. Data Preparation
The data preparation phase covers all activities needed to construct the final dataset or data that will be fed into the modeling tool(S) from the initial raw data. Tasks include table, records, and attribute selection, as well as transformation and cleaning of data for modeling tools. 

***Generic Tasks:***
- Select data.
- Clean data.
- Construct data.
- Integrate data.
- Format data.

## 4. Modeling
In this phase, various modeling techniques are selected and applied, and their parameters are calibrated to optimal values. 

***Generic Tasks:***
- Select modeling techniques.
- Generate test design.
- Build model.
- Assess model.

## 5. Evaluation
At this stage you have built a model that appears to have high quality from a data analysis perspective. Before proceeding to final deployment of the model, it is important to thoroughly evaluate it and review the steps executed to create it, to be certain the model properly achieves the business objectives. A key objective is to determine if there is some important business issue that has not been sufficiently considered.  

***Generic Tasks:***
- Evaluate results.
- Review process.
- Determine next steps.

### 6. Deployment 

Creation of the model is generally not the end of the project. Even if the purpose of the model is to increase knowledge of the data, the knowledge gained will need to be organized and presented ina way that the customer can use it. It often involves applying "live" models within an organization's decision making processes. Depending on the requirements, the deployment phase can be as simple as generating a report or as complex as implemnting a repeatable data mining process across the enterprise.  

***Generic Tasks:***
- Plan deployment.
- Plan monitoring and maintenance.
- Produce final report.
- Review project.
