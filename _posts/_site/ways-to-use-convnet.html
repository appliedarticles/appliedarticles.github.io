<h2 id="1-building-convnet-from-scratch">[1]. Building ConvNet from Scratch</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Build your own ConvNet from scratch</li>
  <li>Use dataset to train the model</li>
  <li>Classify the object</li>
</ol>

<p>(When to use: New dataset is large and very different from the original dataset)</p>

<h2 id="2-use-pre-trained-convnet">[2]. Use pre-trained ConvNet</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Take pre-trained ConvNet(VGGNet, AlexNet, etc)</li>
  <li>Use similar kind of dataset to perform prediction as used by pre-trained ConvNet.</li>
  <li>Use ConvNet directly(without modifying any parameter used in model) to classify the object</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="3-use-pre-trained-convnet-as-fixed-feature-extractor---transfer-learning">[3]. Use pre-trained ConvNet as fixed Feature Extractor - Transfer Learning</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Take a ConvNet(like VGG16) pretrained on dataset(ike ImageNet)</li>
  <li>Remove the last fully-connected layer (this layerâ€™s outputs are the 1000 class scores for a different task like ImageNet)</li>
  <li>Then treat the rest of the ConvNet as a fixed feature extractor for the new dataset</li>
  <li>Use the extracted feature to train a linear classifier(e.g. Linear SVM or Softmax classifier) for the new dataset</li>
  <li>Classify the object</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="4-fine-tuning-the-pre-trained-convnet---transfer-learning">[4]. Fine-tuning the Pre-trained ConvNet - Transfer Learning</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Not only replace and retrain the classifier on top of the ConvNet on the new dataset, but to also fine-tune the weights of the pretrained network by continuing the backpropagation.</li>
  <li>Fine-tune all the layers of the ConvNet, or keep some of the earlier layers fixed (due to overfitting concerns) and only fine-tune some higher-level portion of the network.</li>
</ol>

<p>(When to use: New dataset is large and similar to the original dataset)</p>
